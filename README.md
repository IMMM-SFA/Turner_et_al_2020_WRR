Data-driven reservoir simulation in a large-scale hydrological and water resource model

S. Turner, K. Doering, N. Voisin

File naming convention: `DamDataSource_DamNameOrCode_Experiment_ReservoirScheme`

Experiment numbers are as described in the paper:
- 1 - Offline: observed inflows, storage set to observed
- 2 - Offline: observed inflows, storage allowed to depart from observed
- 3 - Online: LHM-simulated inflows, storage allowed to depart from observed

Reservoirs schemes are as described in the paper:
- A - Generic
- B - Data-driven (1-week inflow)
- C - Data-driven (Dynamic horizons)
